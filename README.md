# Software-version-testing-script
#To check Software version 
This script will check the software version that we mention inside the script like ‘*Software name*’ and displays the output with the version number and export the result as a text file.

For that we must create a text document as “hostnames.txt” in that we can add the list of servers and save it in a separate folder where we want to run the script.

Note:-
Add the list of servers in “hostname.txt” and Change the name of software as shown in the control panel and finally you get the output on the same path.
